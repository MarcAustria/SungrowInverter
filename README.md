# SungrowInverter
A python library for Sungrow Inverters.
Note: The code is optimized for Inverter SH10RT, but can be used for other SungrowInverters aswell. However, not all implemented codes might work with other Inverters. Those are mostly additional codes,  for hybrid Inverters, that can be easily ignored.
